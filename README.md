KPI Dental Dashboard involved the development of a Data Analytics Web Application Dashboard for a well-established dental clinic, Longworth Dental Clinic. 
The dashboard provides a vital visual representation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other key metrics, enabling the clinic to make informed decisionsbased on real-time data.
          

## Collaborative Development
The project was executed through a combination of individual and team efforts, emphasizing efficiency and user experience. 
Close collaboration with the client facilitated the consolidation of essential documents, including the Requirements Document, Project Scope, 
Project Plan, and Project Design Document. Utilizing Agile methodology, the project flow and source code were integrated into open-source platforms 
such as Atlassian and GitHub. Effective communication within the team and regular client meetings ensured alignment throughout the project.
                  

## Technical Implementation
The standout feature of the application is its ability to allow users to upload CSV files containing weekly data to the platform database downloaded 
from the clinic's local server utilizing batch jobs. Subsequent analysis is performed using a sophisticated algorithm, generating visualizations 
tailored to the clientâ€™s specifications.

The project involved working with proprietary software and managing data transfer between external databases and the existing system. 
The JavaScript library Plotly was utilized for dynamic and interactive data visualizations, ensuring that the clinic can easily interpret and leverage their insights.
